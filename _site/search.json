My guess just from eyeballing it was between 31-37. I wanted to get the exact answer so I decided to make a program to do so. This gave me the age of 33 which means they were born in 1991.

    "text": "QUESTION|TASK 4\nThink of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot the usage of that name and see how changes line up with the movie release. Does it look like the movie had an effect on usage?\nLooking at the line graph that I have provided you can see that the name Forrest started off with some pretty high usage between 1915-1930. Through the next couple decades it seems to have a slow decline until the release of the film “Forrest Gump” in 1994. You can see the spike in the graph and how much this movie effected the usage of the name. I decided to see the percent increase in the name Forrest from 1984-1994. It turned out to be around 443%. Knowing this I can come to the conclusion that the film “Forrest Gump” greatly effected the usage of the name.\n::: {#cell-Q4 table .cell .tbl-cap-location-top tbl-cap=‘Not much of a table’ execution_count=11}\n\ntable example\n# Include and execute your code here\n\nforrest_data = df.query(\"name == 'Forrest'\")\n\nfig = px.line(forrest_data, x='year', y='Total', title='Occurrences of the name \"Forrest\" over the years')\n\n\n\n\nfig.add_annotation(\n    dict(\n        x=1994,\n        y=forrest_data['Total'].max(),\n        text='Forrest Gump Release(1994)',\n        showarrow=True,\n        arrowhead=2,\n        arrowcolor='red',\n        arrowwidth=2,\n        ax=20,\n        ay=-80, \n    )\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n:::",
