What ages would you not guess?\nLooking at the bar chart that I created above I could get a pretty good idea of what year Brittany was most likely to be born in. My guess just from eyeballing it was between 31-37. I wanted to get the exact answer so I decided to make a program to do so. I did this by adding up all of the years in the data set in which Brittany was born and then dividing it by the total occurrences they were born. This gave me the year 1991. I subtracted that from 2024 to get 33. So if I was on the phone I would guess someone named Brittany would be around 33. I would not guess that they were younger than 20 and older than 45.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\nbrittany_data = df.query(\"name == 'Brittany'\")\n\n\nIn this cell I simplely just got all of the brittany data using the query method.
